Settings Menu
[ ] Introduce a "Settings" menu in your GUI. (In Progress)
[ ] Design a settings structure (TOML, consider Zmac paths, MAME flags, other preferences).
Action Items:
	{ } Path to Zmac executable (with a default)
	{ } Path to MAME executable (with a default)
	{ } Option to use .z80 or .asm for the source extension
	{ } Option to always start MAME in debug mode
	{ } Add custom Zmac command-line flags
	{ } Add custom mame command-line flags
[ ] Implement persistent settings storage using a settings.toml file within the C:\Users\USI\BAPD\_Programs\config directory.
[X]Install the toml library: pip install toml

2. Installation & Configuration Check on Startup
[ ] On startup, run a routine to validate:
[ ] File Structure: Existence of expected project directories.
[ ] Zmac Presence: Check for zmac.exe in its expected location.
[ ] MAME Presence: Check for mame64.exe.
[ ] Configuration Validity (Optional): Load settings and identify any invalid configurations.

3. Archive Button
[ ] Implement the "Archive" button to create a "versions" directory within the current project.
[ ] On button click, save a timestamped (or version-numbered) copy of the current .asm file into the "versions" directory.
[ ] Auto-archive the current source file on program exit.

4. Dynamic GUI Resizing
[ ] Output Window Expansion: Resize the output window as the main window resizes.
[ ] Component Rearrangement: Adapt the placement of other GUI elements as needed.
[ ] Optional Fullscreen: Explore making the window toggle between regular and fullscreen modes.

5. Basic Formatting in Output Window
[ ] Investigate using bold font and colors within the output window. Consider limitations if relying on QPlainTextEdit.
[ ] If necessary for richer formatting, explore the trade-offs of switching to QTextEdit.

6. Project Data Structure
[ ] Encapsulate project information (name, path, settings) within an object for better organization and scalability.

7. Ongoing Code Cleanup and Optimization
[IN PROGRESS] Code review

8. Splash Screen (Low Priority)
[ ] Create a splash and loading screen on program startup.
