Bally Astrocade Project Development (BAPD) Tool Specifications (Updated)

Project Goal:

Create a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) to streamline the development, compilation, emulation, and debugging of Bally Astrocade projects.

Key Features:

Project Management:
- Create, open, and manage Astrocade projects within a dedicated project directory.
- Display the currently selected project in the main window.
- Open the project folder directly from the application.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
- (Planned) Code editor with syntax highlighting and auto-completion for Astrocade assembly.
- (Planned) Integrated terminal for command-line interaction (Zmac, MAME).
- Output window for displaying compilation results and MAME messages.

Compilation and Emulation:
- Compile Astrocade assembly code using Zmac, with options for outputting a listing file.
- Emulate compiled programs within MAME, with options for debugging.
- Launch MAME with default settings.

Settings and Customization:
- Configure paths to Zmac and MAME executables.
- (Planned) Additional settings for editor preferences, emulator options, and themes.

Technical Specifications:

- Language: Python 3.x
- GUI Framework: PySide6 (Qt) using Designer.
- External Tools: Zmac (compiler), MAME (emulator)
- Configuration Format: TOML (BAPD_settings.toml)
- Configuration File: config.py (contains paths and default settings)

[zmac]
path = "C:/BAPD/_Programs/Zmac"
output_hex_file = true
expand_include_files = false
expand_macros = false
omit_symbol_table = false

[mame]
path = "C:/BAPD/_Programs/MAME"

path = "C:/BAPD/_Programs/ROMS"

[project]

source_file_name = "Astrocade_Program.asm"

Current Implementation:

- GUI:
    - Main window ('main.py') for project selection, compilation, emulation, and output display.
    - Settings dialog ('settings.py') for configuring Zmac and MAME paths.
- Core Functionality:
    - 'main.py': Main application logic, button event handlers, and basic project management.
    - 'settings.py': Settings management logic (loading, saving, handling defaults).
    - 'config.py': Centralized configuration for file paths and default settings.

Planned Enhancements:

- Implement the code editor and integrated terminal.
- Add more robust settings management, including editor preferences and emulator options.
- Incorporate error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
- Explore options for syntax highlighting in the code editor and listing viewer.
- Consider adding features like version control integration and visualizations.
